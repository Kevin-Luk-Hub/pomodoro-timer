# Pomodoro-Timer

Pomodoro timer with minimalist design

The Pomodoro technique is a method of time management used to improve productivity. Using this timer, users will have a 25 minute work session, followed by a 10 minute break. Once this break has ended, users will resume their work, and this cycle will continue. After every fourth work session, there will be a 15 minute break.
